3) The following data were obtained for the growth of a sheep population introduced into a new environment on the island of Tasmania 

![Table](//Users/bcarancibia/CUNY_IS_609/week10/3.png)

a) Make an estimate of M by graphing P(t)

```{r}

pt <- data.frame(year=c(1814,1824,1834,1844,1854,1864), Pt=c(125,275,830,1200,1750,1650))
pt$PtDiff <- rep(NA, nrow(pt))
for(i in 2:nrow(pt))
{
  pt$PtDiff[i] <- pt$Pt[i] - pt$Pt[i - 1]
}
pt
maxPtDiff <- max(pt$PtDiff, na.rm=TRUE)
PtAtMaxDiff <- na.exclude(pt[pt$PtDiff == maxPtDiff,]$Pt)
estimatedM <- PtAtMaxDiff * 2
library(ggplot2)

dfMax <- data.frame(x=c(1814, 1865), y=c(PtAtMaxDiff, PtAtMaxDiff))
g1 <- ggplot(data=pt) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=Pt)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept=estimatedM, slope=0, colour="red") 
g1
```

b) Plot ln[P/(M - P)] against t. If a logistic curve seems reasonable, estimate rM and t*.

```{r}
M <- 1751
pt$LnPMP <- log(pt$Pt/(M - pt$Pt))
pt

g1 <- ggplot(data=pt) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=LnPMP)) 
g1

```

Seems reasonable....though there is a large spike betwee 1850 and 1860. If a logistic curve seems reasonable, estimate rM and t*.

```{r}

rM <- (pt$LnPMP[length(pt$LnPMP)] - pt$LnPMP[1]) / (pt$year[length(pt$year)] - pt$year[1])
rM
t <- -1 * pt$LnPMP[1] / rM
t

pt$year[1] + t
```

6) Suggest other phenomena for which the model described in the text might be used.

The model explained in the text could be used for any problem that has a substance dissolving in a liquid. An example of a problem is below.

A population of insects in a region will grow at a rate that is proportional to their current population.  In the absence of any outside factors the population will triple in two weeks time.  On any given day there is a net migration into the area of 15 insects and 16 are eaten by the local bird population and 7 die of natural causes.  If there are initially 100 insects in the area will the population survive?  If not, when do they die out?

1)

a) Using the estimate that db = 0.054v^2, where 0.054 has dimension ft*hr^2/mi^2, show that the constant k in equation 11.29 has the value of 19.9 ft/sec^2



b) Using the data in Table 4.4, plot db in ft versus v^2/2in ft^2/sec^2 to estimate 1/k directly
